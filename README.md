Music has long been recognized for its therapeutic effects, with a profound ability to influence our mood and mental state. In this project, we explore a dataset from Kaggle to understand how music therapy affects various mental health conditions. By leveraging data science techniques, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that reveal the relationship between music and mental well-being. This analysis not only provides a scientific basis for the benefits of music therapy but also helps in identifying key factors that contribute to its effectiveness. Our approach involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, establishing a baseline, and building multiple machine learning models to predict the impact of music on mental health. We compare these models to determine the most effective one and conclude with an analysis of the findings.
